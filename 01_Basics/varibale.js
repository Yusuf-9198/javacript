/*JavaScript is a dynamically typed language,
meaning variable types are assigned and
checked at runtime instead of compile time.
You can change the type of a variable at any 
time during program execution, which enables flexibility 
but can also lead to potential runtime errors if operations are 
attempted on unexpected types. */
